    <p style="width: 500px;">The Purpose of this meeting was to <b>A</b>: Formally introduce everyone, get everyone
    on the same page, ask about preferences in project development, etc. and <b>B</b>: get our 
    group contract and team building work done for the relevant assignments given by the class. We also did our group bonding event right before I believe. <br>

        <summary>What is codenames?</summary>
        <p style="width: 500px;">Codenames is a team based game where one representative from each team becomes
        the informant, and the rest of their team are agents. The board consists of a 5x5 grid of a random assortment of words. 
        Each word has a color that indicates whos team it belongs to but is only visible to the informants. Each team take turns 
        where the informant will have to choose a word that best matches as many of their own teams color as possible, and the agents will be given some time to discuss 
        which words on the board to select. once they lock in their selection of words, their colors are revealed. Every word belonging to a given team's color awards that team a point, etc.  </p>
